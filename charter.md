public unionism proposes that each city-state is composed of a two-sided system: a labor union and a capital union, joined by a charter that (broadly) outlines the obligations and rights of each permanent resident of the city-state

the capital union is composed of every person with an equity stake in a corporation that is registered in the state. every corporation that operates in the state must register (sign onto the charter) with the union

the labor union is composed of every person who works or lives in the state. every person in the labor union is provided with a form of official identification, and the process of joining the labor union involves signing onto the public union's charter.

just as each corporation is a subunit of the capital union, guilds are the subunit of the labor union. they can span across city-states in the same way that corporations can. guilds engage in collective bargaining with corporations and have internal governance akin to corp boards

the charter that joins the two is the constitution of the city-state. it outlines the fundamental rights (civil liberties) and obligations (mandatory voting, public service) of state residents.  it also describes the structure and function of the government

the government is composed of a legislature, a judiciary, and an executive branch. the legislature is multi-cameral, with chambers centered not on geographic influence but on the basis of time length: 5 years, 20 years, 50 years, and 100 years
